# Web-Scraping
===========================================================================================
In this project we are tested in our skills not only in python coding, but an understanding of all the concepts revolving around it too.
Some  of the main assets used are:
  - PySimpleGUI
  - json
  - csv
  - panda
  - ...
This and including much more. Not only were we tested in our programming skills but our understanding with url's. This may include the
format that are being used to the specified url chosen, and if things such as "www" or "https://" will affect the process (they do not)
=========================================================================================
## Steps 
1. Find a website with the data you are looking for and inspect the window format to see if scrapping is possible (ie.https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/va/charlottesville/KCHO/date/2023-6-20)
2. Next inspect the url and how other of the same data pages differ, in this case it is the Code "KCHO", country "us", state "va", and date "XXXX-XX-XX"(this will prove useful when programming).
3. Following this programming is the base of the project, doing as muc research and understanding al the different methods that could be done to make things easier or difficult.

=======================================================================================
##How to run
Just run Scraper.py and everything should run smoothly(hopefully)
(when it comes to choosing a city of the country you'll need to go to the csv file to find one that corresponds to the country)
when choosing country find the corresponding city that matches with it in the csv file

| [airport-codes.csv](https://github.com/Takaximos/4883-SoftwareTools-Palacios/blob/main/Assignments/A07/airport-codes.csv) | Data          |
| [gui.py](https://github.com/Takaximos/4883-SoftwareTools-Palacios/blob/main/Assignments/A07/gui.py) | GUI          |
| [get_weather.py](https://github.com/Takaximos/4883-SoftwareTools-Palacios/blob/main/Assignments/A07/get_weather.py) | Code to get weather table          |
From there is just a test of programming skill and the end result should look similar to these:
